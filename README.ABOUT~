FB-AODV is a loadable kernel module for Linux. It implements AODV routing in Wireless Mesh Networks. Routes are based on flows (source, destination and ToS. It supports three different routing metrics: Hop count, ETT (link quality aware) and WCIM (link quality, interference and load aware). Implements Gateway discovery using periodoc announcements (based on ST-AODV)

The current implementation is a (very) modified version of the AODV-ST implementation.
